# API Factory for Saas project

Factory API requires Go version 1.22 or higher to run.

## ⚙️ Installation

To start setting up your project. Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it. Then, initialize your project with Go modules by executing the following command in your terminal:

```shell
go mod init github.com/your/repo
```

To learn more about Go modules and how they work, you can check out the [Using Go Modules](https://go.dev/blog/using-go-modules) blog post.

After setting up your project, you can install Factory API with the `go get` command:

```shell
go get -u github.com/saas0503/factory-api
```

This command fetches the Factory Api package and adds it to your project's dependencies, allowing you to start building your web applications.
